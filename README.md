## Introduction

The `poem_generation.ipynb` notebook provides an example of how to train an LSTM-based model with attention for generating poems. It includes steps for data preprocessing, tokenization, model creation, training, and generating poems.

The code in this repository is written in Python and utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Achilles107/robert-frost-poem-generation.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd robert-frost-poem-generation
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook poem_generation.ipynb
```
## Usage

The notebook `poem_generation.ipynb` provides a step-by-step guide on how to generate poems using LSTM and attention. It includes explanations, code snippets, and example outputs.

## Results

After training the model, you can generate poems by calling the `generate_poem()` function and providing a starting text and the number of words you want the poem to have.

Here's an example of generating a poem:

`print(generate_poem('World goes on', 15))`

This will output a poem generated by the trained model based on the given starting text.
